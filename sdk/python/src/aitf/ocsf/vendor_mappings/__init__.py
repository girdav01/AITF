"""AITF Vendor Mapping Files.

This package contains JSON mapping files that translate vendor-native
telemetry attributes to AITF semantic conventions.

Vendors can supply their own mapping files by following the schema
defined at https://aitf.dev/schemas/vendor-mapping-v1.json.

Built-in mappings:
  - langchain.json  – LangChain / LangSmith / LangGraph
  - crewai.json     – CrewAI with LiteLLM
